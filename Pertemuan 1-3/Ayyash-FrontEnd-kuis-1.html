<h1>Mecca (/ˈmɛkə/; officially Makkah al-Mukarramah,[a] commonly shortened to Makkah[b]) is the capital of Mecca
    Province in the Hejaz region of western Saudi Arabia and the holiest city in Islam.[2] It is 70 km (43 mi) inland
    from Jeddah on the Red Sea, in a narrow valley 277 m (909 ft) above sea level. Its last recorded population was
    1,578,722 in 2015.[3] Its estimated metropolitan population in 2020 is 2.042 million, making it the third-most
    populated city in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Jeddah.[citation needed] Pilgrims more than triple this number every
    year during the Ḥajj pilgrimage, observed in the twelfth Hijri month of Dhūl-Ḥijjah.

<h2>Mecca</h2>

<p>Mecca has been referred to by many names. As with many Arabic words, its etymology is obscure.[19] Widely believed to
    be a synonym for Makkah, it is said to be more specifically the early name for the valley located therein, while
    Muslim scholars generally use it to refer to the sacred area of the city that immediately surrounds and includes the
    Ka'bah.[20][21]

    <h2>Bakkah</h2>
    Main article: Bakkah
    The Quran refers to the city as Bakkah in Surah Al Imran (3), verse 96: "Indeed the first House [of worship],
    established for mankind was that at Bakkah". This is said to have been the name of the city at the time of Abraham
    (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition) and it is also transliterated as Baca, Baka, Bakah, Bakka, Becca and Bekka, among
    others.[22][23][24] It was a name for the city in the ancient world.[25]

    Makkah, Makkah al-Mukarramah and Mecca
    Makkah is the official transliteration used by the Saudi government and is closer to the Arabic
    pronunciation.[26][27]
    The government adopted Makkah as the official spelling in the 1980s, but it is not universally known or used
    worldwide.[26] The full official name is <em>Makkah al-Mukarramah</em> (Arabic: مكة المكرمة, lit. 'Makkah the
    Honored').[26]
    Makkah is used to refer to the city in the Quran in Surah Al-Fath (48), verse 24.[19][28]

    Other names
    Another name used for Mecca in the Quran is at 6:92 where it is called Umm al-Qurā, meaning "Mother of all
    Settlements".
    The city has been called several other names in both the Quran and ahadith. Another name used historically for Mecca
    is
    Tihāmah.[32] According to an Islamic suggestion, another name for Mecca, Fārān, is synonymous with the Desert of
    Paran
    mentioned in the Old Testament at Genesis 21:21.[33] Arab and Islamic tradition holds that the wilderness of Paran,
    broadly speaking, is the Tihamah coastal plain and the site where Ishmael settled was Mecca.[33] Yaqut al-Hamawi,
    the
    12th-century Syrian geographer, wrote that Fārān was "an arabized Hebrew word, one of the names of Mecca mentioned
    in
    the Torah."[34] (See also:Wadi Faran)

    <strong>Significance in Islam</strong>
    Mecca holds an important place in Islam and is considered the holiest city in all branches of the religion. The city
    derives its importance from the role it plays in the Hajj and 'Umrah and for its status as the birthplace of the
    Prophet
    Muhammad.

    Masjid al-Haram
    The Masjid al-Haram is the site of two of the most important rites of both the Hajj and of the Umrah, the
    circumambulation around the Ka'bah (tawaf) and the walking between the two mounts of Safa and Marwa (sa'ee). The
    masjid
    is also the site of the Zamzam Well. According to Islamic tradition, a prayer in the masjid is equal to 100,000
    prayers
    in any other masjid around the world.[100]

    Kaaba
    Main article: Kaaba
    There is a difference of opinion between Islamic scholars upon who first built the Ka'bah, some believe it was built
    by
    the angels while others believe it was built by Adam. Regardless, it was built several times before reaching its
    current
    state. The Ka'bah is also the common direction of prayer (qibla) for all Muslims. The surface surrounding the Ka'bah
    on
    which Muslims circumambulate it is known as the Mataf.

    Hajr-e-Aswad (The Black Stone)
    Main article: Black Stone
    The Black Stone is a stone, considered by scientists to be a meteorite or of similar origin and believed by Muslims
    to
    be of divine origin. It is set in the eastern corner of the Ka’bah and it is Sunnah to touch and kiss the stone. The
    area around the stone is generally always crowded and guarded by policemen to ensure the pilgrims' safety. In
    Islamic
    tradition, the stone was sent down from Jannah (Paradise) and used to build the Ka'bah. It used to be a white stone
    (and
    was whiter than milk). Because of the worldly sins of man, it slowly changed color to black over the years after it
    was
    brought down to Earth.

    Human resources
    Formal education started to be developed in the late Ottoman period continuing slowly into Hashemite times. The
    first
    major attempt to improve the situation was made by a Jeddah merchant, Muhammad ʿAlī Zaynal Riḍā, who founded the
    Madrasat al-Falāḥ in Mecca in 1911–12 that cost £400,000.[109] The school system in Mecca has many public and
    private
    schools for both males and females. As of 2005, there were 532 public and private schools for males and another 681
    public and private schools for female students.[119] The medium of instruction in both public and private schools is
    Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language, but some private schools founded by foreign entities such as
    International schools use the English language as the medium of instruction. Some of these are coeducational while
    other
    schools are not. For higher education, the city has only one university, Umm Al-Qura University, which was
    established
    in 1949 as a college and became a public university in 1981.

    Healthcare is provided by the Saudi government free of charge to all pilgrims. There are ten main hospitals in
    Mecca:[120]
